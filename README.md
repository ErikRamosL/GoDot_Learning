# GoDot_Learning
Tutorials and projects to learn how to use GoDot.

The first tutorial is https://youtu.be/Mc13Z2gboEk
creating a platformer to get familiar with the GoDot Workflow;

Creating a player node and adding a script to let the player control it, enemies the player can die to, or stomp for points. Coins the player can collect to add more points to the score, a portal to change the level. A Pause menu that lets you retry the level, go back to the main menu, or quit the game. A Main screen and an end screen to start the game, or try again, or quit the game. Text that lets you know how much score you have collected from the coins and enemies. 
This was finished in January 14th 2023.
